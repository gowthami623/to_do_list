# to_do_list
In this project, we will develop a Python program that allows users to manage tasks by adding, completing, and removing them. This project serves as a beginner-friendly introduction to Python programming, covering fundamental concepts such as data structures, input/output handling, and basic control flow.

## Description:
In this project, we will develop a Python program that allows users to manage tasks by adding, completing, and removing them. This project serves as a beginner-friendly introduction to Python programming, covering fundamental concepts such as data structures, input/output handling, and basic control flow.

## Features to Implement:

**Add Tasks:** 
  Users should be able to add tasks to their to-do list. Each task will have a unique identifier and a description.

**Complete Tasks:**
  Users should be able to mark tasks as completed. Completed tasks will be removed from the to-do list.

**Remove Tasks:**
  Users should have the option to remove tasks from the to-do list.

**Display Tasks:**
  The program should display the current list of tasks along with their status (completed or pending).

## Key Concepts Covered:

**Variables and Data Types:**
  Utilize variables to store task information such as identifiers and descriptions. Understand data types such as strings and integers.

**Lists:**
  Utilize lists to store multiple tasks. Perform operations such as adding, removing, and accessing elements from lists.

**Conditional Statements:**
  Use conditional statements (if-else) to implement logic for task completion and removal.

**Loops:**
  Implement loops (for or while) to iterate over tasks and display them.

**User Input:**
  Use input() function to accept user input for adding, completing, and removing tasks.

**Functions:**
  Organize code into functions to encapsulate specific tasks such as adding, completing, and removing tasks.


## Learning Objectives:

Gain familiarity with basic Python syntax and data structures.

Understand how to organize code into functions for better maintainability and reusability.

Practice problem-solving and algorithmic thinking through implementing task management features.

By the end of this project, participants will have developed a simple yet functional task management program using Python, providing them with a solid foundation to explore more advanced Python concepts and real-world applications.
